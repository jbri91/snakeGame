<!-- Snake Game Week 1 Modules -->
<!-- 
    -Single Page Site
    -Rules of the game:
      - Snake game ends when:
          - Snake touches itself
          - Snake touches the outside of the border
    Snake grows one length when it eats the apple
    A new apple should randomly regenerate when the apple is eaten
    snake is controlled by arrows of the keyboard
    One point should be added to the schore when an apple is eaten.

<!-- To Do This Week
Create new git repository locally
Create 'ReadMe' file in git repository
Push git repository to GitHub
Create a wireframe for the game (Basic skeleton of the game)
Watch 'Code Your First Game' Udemy Course
-->

<!-- 'Code Your First Game' Udemy Course
-Objective: 
Understand game design basics
Learn how to use javaScript and HTML to implement game

How to use the course most effectively
As you learn:
Take breaks and work on your snake game
Tinker with ideas
Take things in a different direction than the instructor intended
Make Mistakes
-->

<!-- Create Wireframe
Layout for the snake game. The simplest. 
wireframe.cc
-->

<!-- Due by Week 2
GitHub repository is created

How to Break Down the Snake Game App

Small Chunking
-Think about the smallest thing you could do right now to make progress?
-Start small
-Focus on one part
Do not worry about perfection
Write down every tiny step you'll need to accomplish

Focus on progress
Embrace the 'hacker' mentality
Don't worry about mistakes (Make as many as you can)
Source control (git) will make sure you can fix any mistakes
When you are stuck, reach out for help.

Utilize your resources
Head First Javascript book
Code Your First Game Udemy Course
Scrimba tutorial
Implement what you learn at the same time.
Google is your friend 

Week 2
Create a second branch in Git for week number two.
Create gameboard
Move the snake across the game board
control the snake using the keyboard
draw the apple on the game board
when complete, merge it into the master branch

Robust funcitonality
Getting information
height, width
Drawing Shapes, images, etc.
sdmm.link/html-canvas
sdmm.link/set-interval
sdmm.link/keydown-event

How to Depict Movement
Run a game 'loop'
Draw the images on the canvasUpdate the underlying data (snake, apple)

Think about movement as a flip-book animations.
Snake moves like links in a chain

Week 3
Boundary detection
Randomize food placement
Create a branch in Git for week number three
Set up a debugging environment
Create functionality: Snake boundary detection
Random apple placement
When completed, merge the branches.

Set up a Debugging Environment
- Purpose: To make testing functionality easy.
Reduce time spent 'testing'
Avoid making permanent changes to your code.
sdmm.link/debug-env
Focus on the snake head and the board being a grid.

During each game iteration: 
check if the snake head is touching any of the four walls or the apple.

Come up with your own solutions.

Create random apple placement functionality.
Focus on random placement:
within the gameboard dimension
but not where the snake is currently

Week 4
Audit current progress (figure out what needs to be wrapped up)
Write down inventory of things you need to do.
Wrap up all loose ends.
When close to completion, post int eh community asking for feedback. Ask for general feedback. 

Complete readme file after your project is done.

Purpose:
Grabs attention
Shows thoughtfullness and effort beyond the 'bare minimum'.
Contains useful information. 
What technologies were used.
How to run the project locally. 
sdmm.link/markdown
sdmm.link/readme-directions

No glaring bugs or problems
readme file is complete
all extra branches/files/etc. are cleaned up
