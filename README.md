# Summary

The snake game was a challenging project. The parts I had the most trouble with were getting the snake to move like a snake and handling all the different functions linked with the onload function. I used more for loops in this project than my past projects. It helped me get a better understanding of how to use them.

I added a high score component to it because I wanted to be able to try and beat the score everytime I come back to the game. To do that, I included local storage. It was not a part of the task but figured it would be a nice addition because I wanted this to be more competitive. It also gave me alittle bit more practice with local storage too!
